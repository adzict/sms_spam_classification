## Project Introduction
<a name="Project_Introduction"></a>

The SMS Spam Collection is a public set of SMS labeled messages that have been collected for mobile phone spam research. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham". This is important because spam messages can be a nuisance and even pose a security risk if they contain phishing scams or malicious links. By accurately identifying spam messages, users can avoid them and better protect their personal information.

## Project Description
<a name="Project_Description"></a>

This project is a machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The model achieved an accuracy of 0.97 using Multilayer Perceptron.
